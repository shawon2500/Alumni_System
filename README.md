# IIT-Alumni_System
When an educational institution gets bigger then the spread of former students in many jobs and businesses are wider. Then communication and detail finding of all the students and teachers is not very easy because of different background and diversity in their job. They frequently need to find the details of other former students or teachers so that they can contact them or know their current workplace or any other details. So, it is important that all of the former students and teachers are in a same system so that they can find anyone easily. “IIT Alumni System” is such a program that can make it possible. In this program we have kept details of teachers and former students in time of the registration and once the registration request is approved by admin then the will receive a message to login. Then they can view their own information, update it and search any other student or teacher with various categories and specific search keys. This will help them to find all the details in one system so that they don’t have to waste their time in searching the details and find their friends, juniors, seniors and teachers in amount of a short time. In a word, it is a very useful and simple program for storing and searching information together in one place.
